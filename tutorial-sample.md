This is a brief sample tutorial on how to create a GitHub Repository that I created using markdown.


To create a GitHub repository, locate the ![Plus](/assets/images/create-git-repo/button-plus.png) button. Click on it to display the menu then select the **New repository** option.

<div class="card">
  <div class="card__image">

  </div>
</div>

This will display the **Create a new repository** screen.

Here, you must first enter a name for your repository. If the name is available, a green tick symbol will indicate so.

This screen contains the following fields:

* **Repository name:** mandatory text field where you must enter your repository name.
* **Description:** optional text field that allows you to enter a repository description.
* **Public/Private:** mutually exclusive radio buttons that will determine whether your repository is public or private. The **Public** option is selected by default.
* **Add a Readme file:** optional checkbox. Selecting it generates a readme file for your repository. You should use this file to write a long description for your project.
* **Add .gitignore:** optional checkbox. Selecting it adds a .gitignore file to your repository. Use this file to choose which files not to track from a list of templates.
* **Choose a license:** optional checkbox. This option lets you choose a license, which tells others what they can and can't do with your code.

After you've completed the required information on this screen, and selected the desired options, click on ![Create Repo Button](/assets/images/create-git-repo/button-create-repo.png) to create your repository.

The contents of your newly created repository will display as a result, and you can start working on it:
