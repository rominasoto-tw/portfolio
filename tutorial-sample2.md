This is a brief sample tutorial on how to use **Visual Studio Code** for your online GitHub documentation, using markdown.


## VSC Overview

### About the software

![VSC logo](/assets/images/vsc/visualstudiocodelogo.png){:.border.shadow}

Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.

### Aim of this documentation

This brief tutorial explains the use of VSC as a documentation tool for technical writers working with markdown.

### License

VSC is an open source tool, free for public or commercial use.

## Navigation

### First steps

![VSC - Getting started](/assets/images/vsc/vsc-01.png){:.border.shadow}

When you open the software you are welcomed by the Getting Started screen. This screen contains a few useful shortcuts to actions such as:

* New File
* Open File
* Open Folder
* Run a Command

You will also find a link to your recently used files, projects and folders, if you have used it before.

In order to carry out this tutorial successfully, you must have created and cloned your project GitHub repository in your computer, as we will be using it to work.

### Working on your project

You can use VSC to open files, folders, or projects. In this case, you will open your local repository folder. In order to do so, you must access the **File** menu, located at the upper left corner of the screen, and select the **Open Folder** option.

Clicking on this option prompts you to select a folder to open. Here, you will navigate to your locally cloned GitHub repository, and select the folder that contains it. As a result, the entire folder and its contents will display in tree form.

This allows for a seamless project navigation, where you can easily find the files you need to work on.

## Extensions

### What are extensions for

In general terms, **VSC extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow**. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code.

To access the **Extensions** section of the software, click on the *Extensions* icon, located on the left of the screen.

### Navigating extensions

![VSC - Extensions section](/assets/images/vsc/vsc-05.png){:.border.shadow}

The **Extensions** section features a search tool, which you can use to find extensions you might require to in order to work more comfortably.

If you have extensions already installed, these will be featured under the search tool, as shown in the image above.

Finally, a selection of recommended extensions are displayed at the bottom of the section.

### Search extensions

As you type in your search, the search tool starts to offer possible results that match your search criteria. There is no need to press enter to start the search.

In the above example, the word *Markdown* has been entered in the search tool, and you can see all possible search results below it. Recommended extensions have a blue and white star symbol to the left of their name.

*To install an extension*, simply click on the blue and white *Install* button located to the right of each extension.

If you wish to see detailed information about the extension before you install it, simply click on it, and additional information will display to the right of the **Extensions** section.

VSC is compatible with markdown. Whether you create a markdown file (md) from scratch or edit an existing one in your project, VSC will highlight syntax so you can easily find errors, and provide a preview of what you’re doing, so you can visualize your work before committing your changes to GitHub.
