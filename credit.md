I used the [TeXt Jekyll template](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme/) by **Tian Qi** to create this static website. This template is registered under attribution non-commercial 4.0 international [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

I've modified it as necessary in order to use it to showcase my work.
